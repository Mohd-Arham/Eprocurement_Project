                                            This involves the buyer selling the item to a supplier. Bidders have to quote higher prices than the start price. Start price is the lowest possible price. The supplier with highest bid is the top rank bidder & the buyer can move ahead to offer a contract to supplier. Offering the contract depends on various factors such as lead time, capacity, quality, & value adding possibilities.</p>

                                            The second type of auction is the opposite of forward auction. In this buyers are the ones who purchase items from suppliers. The main determining factors in awarding a bid depend on the price. The buyer will award the contract to the supplier with the lowest bidding price. The contract awarding depends on specification &amp; needs of the buyer such as value adding capabilities, capacity, quality &amp; lead time.</p>
